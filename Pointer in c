#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int a = 10;
    int *p;

    p = &a;   // Store address of a in pointer p

    printf("Value of a = %d\n", a);
    printf("Address of a = %p\n", &a);
    printf("Pointer p stores = %p\n", p);
    printf("Value through pointer = %d\n", *p);

    return 0;
}
Output
Value of a = 10
Address of a = 0x7fff7e5b7434
Pointer p stores = 0x7fff7e5b7434
Value through pointer = 10
